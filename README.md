# Objects, Functions and Arrays

This challenge focuses on functions, objects and arrays. You'll convert "traditional" functions into functions that use the ES6 arrow syntax. You'll also manipulate objects and traverse arrays.

__THE USE OF _MOST_ HIGHER-ORDER ARRAY METHODS IS FORBIDDEN!__ These would be array methods that take callbacks as arguments and save you from having to loop manually, such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`,`forEach` etc. **You'll have to make do with good old loops!** 

Commit often! **Plan to commit & push every time you get a new test passing**. This makes it SO much easier to figure out "what broke my code", and helps your TL keep track of how you're doing.

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set up Project

- [x ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ x] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github
- [x ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [x ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [x ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [x ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`

### Task 2 - MVP

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your returns look like the expected returns. Do not use any of the forbidden methods!

### Task 3 - Stretch

There are several stretch goals inside `index.js`. You may work on these once you have finished MVP requirements for the day!

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master
